# System Identification and Analysis

This is the final project I did for the Linear Dynamic System class. It is related to 
a linear MIMO system with two inputs and two outputs. There are five main tasks:

## Task #1: Model identication
Find A, B, C, D matrices based on the observed impulse response so that:

\begin{gather*} 
\textbf{x}_{k+1} = A\textbf{x}_{k} + B\textbf{u}_{k} \\
\textbf{y}_{k} = C\textbf{x}_{k}
\end{gather*}
