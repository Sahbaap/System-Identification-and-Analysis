# System Identification and Analysis

This is the final project I did for the Linear Dynamic System class. It is related to 
a linear MIMO system with two inputs and two outputs. There are five main tasks:

## Task #1: Model identication from Impulse response
<!--Find A, B, C, D matrices based on the observed impulse response so that:

## Task #2: Transmission zeros of the MIMO model and zeros of each channel

## Task #3: Impulse response identication from white noise inputs

## Task #4: H_2 norm analysis of identified model

## Task #5: H_{inf} norm analysis of identified model
